# Herzing-SE6

## Description:
The day is reduced to 12 seconds for simulation purposes. 24hrs = 24 seconds. Cut in half again for simulation to 12 seconds.
5 events with a 2 second delay each = 10 seconds. There should be another 2 second delay at the end of each iteration, 
but for the sake of time is excluded from simulation. The images show events for days 1-3 and the last day. 
The FSM runs for 7 simulated days and produces 5 random events everyday.

The Flow is the randomly generated number between 0-2. The Status (1-4) is the result of the flow number. 
I inclide the Flow and Status numbers on every Event Print-Out for testing purposes.

An old professor (from OOPII) once told me he would like to see the thread created inside of the object. Nuff said.
